1. Introduction					    *NCM2-introduction*

NCM2, formerly known as nvim-completion-manager, is a slim, fast hackable
completion framework, for neovim.

Main features:

1. Fast and asynchronous completion support, with vimscript friendly API.
2. Smart on files with different languages, for example, css/javascript
   completion in html style/script tag.
3. Function parameter expansion support using ncm2-plugin.

Here's a list of links where you can find extensions for ncm2.

3. Vimrc Examples			        *NCM2-vimrc*

Install using vim-plug:
>
    " assuming your using vim-plug: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug
    Plug 'ncm2/ncm2'
    " ncm2 requires nvim-yarp
    Plug 'roxma/nvim-yarp'

    " enable ncm2 for all buffer
    autocmd BufEnter * call ncm2#enable_for_buffer()

    " note that must keep noinsert in completeopt, the others is optional
    set completeopt=noinsert,menuone,noselect
<
Optional vimrc tips:
>
    " supress the annoying 'match x of y', 'The only match' and 'Pattern not
    " found' messages
    set shortmess+=c

    " CTRL-C doesn't trigger the InsertLeave autocmd . map to <ESC> instead.
    inoremap <c-c> <ESC>

    " When the <Enter> key is pressed while the popup menu is visible, it only
    " hides the menu. Use this mapping to close the menu and also start a new
    " line.
    inoremap <expr> <CR> (pumvisible() ? "\<c-y>\<cr>" : "\<CR>")

    " Use <TAB> to select the popup menu:
    inoremap <expr> <Tab> pumvisible() ? "\<C-n>" : "\<Tab>"
    inoremap <expr> <S-Tab> pumvisible() ? "\<C-p>" : "\<S-Tab>"

    " wrap existing omnifunc
    " Note that omnifunc does not run in background and may probably block the
    " editor. If you don't want to be blocked by omnifunc too often, you could
    " add 180ms delay before the omni wrapper:
    "  'on_complete': ['ncm2#on_complete#delay', 180,
    "               \ 'ncm2#on_complete#omni', 'csscomplete#CompleteCSS'],

4. Settings					    *NCM2-settings*

                                    *g:ncm2#complete_delay* 
g:ncm2#complete_delay 
            Wait for an interval, in milliseconds, before starting to compute
            completions. This is useful when dealing with slow, sync
            completion source.
			Default: 0

                                    *g:ncm2#popup_delay*
g:ncm2#popup_delay
            Adds a delay before the popup menu actually popups up. This
            reduces popup menu flickering when multiple sources is updating
            the popup menu in a short interval.
			Default: 100

                                    *g:ncm2#matcher*
g:ncm2#matcher
            Available builtin matchers:
            "prefix"
                match if the typing is the prefix of the completion item.
            "substr"
                match if the typing is a substring of the completion item.
            Default: "prefix"

                                    *g:ncm2#sorter*
g:ncm2#sorter
			Available builtin sorters:
            "swapcase_word"
                use the swapped-case word as the sort key.
            Default: "swapcase_word"

                                    *g:ncm2#filter*
g:ncm2#filter
            Filter the completion items. Could be a string or a list of
            strings. Filters are chained to filter the matches.
			Available filters:
            "same_word"
                Filter out the items which have the same word as your typing.

                                    *g:ncm2#auto_popup*
g:ncm2#auto_popup
            If set to 0, then you have to map the
            `<Plug>(ncm2_manual_trigger)` key, and use this key to trigger the
            completion.
			Default: 1

						            *g:ncm2#complete_length*
g:ncm2#complete_length
			The default value for |ncm2-complete_length|.

			Default: `[[1,4],[7,3]]`
            Format: a |List| as [[ min priority, min len ],...], or single
            integer value.

            The default value means that sources with priority between 1 and 6
            will have the value of 4, and sources with priority >= 7 will have
            the value of 3.  

            Priority >= 7 is more semantic completion source, So it's better
            to use a smaller value to trigger the popup than others.

5. API						            *NCM2-API*

						            *ncm2#register_source()*
ncm2#register_source({source})
	Register a completion source. {source} is a |Dict| that defines the
	source, it may contain these fields:

	name					        *NCM2-name*
			Required, the unique name of the completion source.

	mark				            *NCM2-mark*
            This field might be displayed in the popup item to indicate the
            completion source.

	enable	Defaults to 1. If set to 0, it will only be triggered by
            `<Plug>(ncm2_manual_trigger)`

	priority				        *NCM2-priority*
            Required, the priority is used to sort between other sources. A
            higher value indicates that the completion item of this source
            sorts before sources with lower priority value.  

						            *NCM2-priority-values*
			Recommended priority definitions: 
            2	keyword from the otherfiles, from user's openning browsers,
                etc.
			4	keyword from openning buffers
			5	keyword from current buffer
			6	file path
			7	snippet hint
			8	language specific keyword, but not smart
			9	smart programming language aware completion


	scope				        	*NCM2-scope*
            A |List| of scope. The source will be activated when the current
            editting scope (e.g. current 'filetype') is in the source's scope
            list. 
            If this field is not set, it means this is a general purpose
            completion source, like keyword from buffer, it will be activated
            for all buffers.

	on_complete				        *NCM2-on_complete*
            Function name of the handler for the completion request.

	auto_popup
            If 0, only the |<Plug>(ncm2_manual_trigger)| key can trigger the
            completion of this source.
			Default: 1

	word_pattern				    *NCM2-word_pattern*
			The pattern used to calculate |NCM2-startcol|.

	complete_length		    	    *NCM2-complete_length*
            The minimum length of the matching word for auto triggering popup
            menu.

            If it contains a negative value, completion will only be triggered
            by complete_pattern.

	complete_pattern			    *NCM2-complete_pattern*
            An extra |List| of PCRE patterns (python regex), besides
            complete_length, for auto triggering popup menu. 

    Here are some examples, shich should give you some hint about how
    word_pattern, complete_pattern and complete_length works.
>
        complete_length: 3
        complete_pattern: ['\.']
        word_pattern: '\w+'

            typing            : foo_service.request()
            complete trigger  :   ^        ^
            startccol         : x           x
            base              : [.........] [.....]

            typing            : fd.read()
            complete trigger  :   ^
            base              :    [..]

        complete_length: -1
        complete_pattern: ['/']
        word_pattern: '\S+'

            typing           : first/second/third
            complete trigger :      ^      ^
            startccol        : x
            base             : [................]
<
                                    *ncm2#complete()*
ncm2#complete({context}, {startccol}, {matches}[, {refresh}])
    Call this function to trigger the to feed completions to ncm2.

    {context} is an arugment passed to the |NCM2-on_complete| handler. Don't
    modify the contents. It is important for synchronization. 

    {startccol} and {matches} are are similar to vim's builtin |complete()|
    function. Except that startccol is counted by characters instead of by
    bytes.

    {refresh} is 0 by default. Normally ncm2 will cache the result properly.
    set it to 1 if you want another on_complete notification as the the user
    types.

						            *ncm2#disable_source()*
ncm2#disable_source({name})
    Disable the registered source.

					            	*ncm2#context()*
ncm2#context()
    Get the current typing context. This function returns a |Dict|, some of
    the fields are described here.

    Note: Other undocumented fields are necessary for the framework to work,
    do not change these values.

	bufnr		
			Same as `bufnr('%')`.

	lnum		
			Same as `line('.')`.

	ccol		
			Similar to `col('.')` but it's counted by characters.

	filetype	
			Same as 'filetype' of the buffer.

	typed
			The typed text. For example:
				`^foo bar|baz`

			Where `^` indicates the start of line, and `|`
			indicates cursor position. This field should be:
			"foo bar"

	filepath
            The path of current editting file. Same as `expand('%:p')`

    When the context is passed to |NCM2-on_complete|, it has some extra
    fields:

	scope
			Current editting scope.

	startccol				            *NCM2-startccol*
            Calaulated by NCM2 for convenience, usually you could pass it as
            an argument to the |ncm2#complete()| function.

	base
            Set according to the startccol. The value is the same as the
            {base} passed to |complete-functions|.

						                 *ncm2#context_dated()*
ncm2#context_dated({context})
	Check if the {context} is dated.

						*ncm2#enable_for_buffer()*
ncm2#enable_for_buffer()
	Enable ncm2 for current buffer.

						*ncm2#disable_for_buffer()*
ncm2#disable_for_buffer()
	Disable ncm2 for current buffer.

						*<Plug>(ncm2_manual_trigger)*
<Plug>(ncm2_manual_trigger)
			A key to trigger the completion manually.
